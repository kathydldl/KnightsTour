c++ knight's tour using DFS and Warnsdoff's algorithm

Compile:
$ make  
*Note: As I’m using Macbook to compile and run the application, I use the C++11 compiler “clang++ -stdlib=libc++ -std=gnu++11” in Makefile, this might change with different environments.*

Run:
$ make run  
*Note: As the main function contains an infinite loop for continuous running cycles, please hit “Control + C” to exit.*

Clean:
$ make clean
